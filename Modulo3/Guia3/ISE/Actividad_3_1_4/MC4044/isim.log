ERROR: at 0 ps: Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "/home/fede/Documents/Jaquenod/Jaquenod/Modulo3/Guia3/ISE/Actividad_3_1_4/MC4044/Sources/MC4044.vhd" Line 101. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
